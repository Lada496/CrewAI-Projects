I tokenized essays with Keras, used pre-trained GloVe embeddings to capture semantic meaning, and trained an LSTM to model word sequences. I evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error to measure prediction accuracy and exact-match accuracy for precise scoring. I also analyzed high-error essays to refine preprocessing and model parameters. This project helped me effectively apply tokenization, embeddings, and sequence modeling while understanding how evaluation metrics guide model improvements.\n",
